# Deployed Honeypots

All my implementation was right, I could see the attacks but they werent getting saved in the json file. 

But when I got to look at the results from my partner, I've observed that the attacks are very quick and from different parts of the world.The below picture belongs to my partner. All the available ports were attacked.
